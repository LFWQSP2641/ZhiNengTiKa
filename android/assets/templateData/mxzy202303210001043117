Liden decided that he would not pick out a ring from a jeweler's like most other people.He hatched an ambitious plan to create a personalized ring for his future wife，Desirae Clovis.Therefore，he made up his mind to go into the wild to find his own materials：the diamond，the gold and the accompanying jewels.</p><p>So，in May 2022，Liden told Clovis that he and Josh Tucker，his best friend，were heading out on a camp to Yellowstone.Instead，he and Tucker made for Crater of Diamonds State Park，Arkansas，which is set on a volcanic crater.The park is one of the few places in the world where the public is welcome to search for real diamonds and can keep them for free.Since its opening，only 1 in 10,000 park visitors is lucky enough to find a diamond that weighs a carat or more.Still，he was up for the challenge.</p><p>On their way，Liden and Tucker stopped in Helena，Montana，to mine for accompanying jewels to add to the diamond they hoped to score.In Arkansas，the pair paid $10 each to get into the park and spent almost three days searching through the volcanic dirt.</p><p>On the third morning，Liden suddenly spotted something reflecting light in the sands.&ldquo;I was so excited that I started shaking，&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;It was oily and shiny，and we both just knew it was a diamond.&rdquo;</p><p>It was confirmed that Liden had found a 2.2-carat yellow diamond.Similarly-sized diamonds go for $2,500 to $20,000 per carat，depending on quality，color and cut.But the value wasn't what was important to Liden.</p><p>When he pulled out the diamond and got on his knee upon his return，Clovis was
