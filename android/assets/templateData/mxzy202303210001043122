living in informal settlements across the world often go to dangerous lengths to secure clean water and electricity.Now，Henry Glogau，a New Zealand-based architectural designer，has created a striking skylight(天窗) that can provide both safely.</p><p>In Chile，around 110,000 families live in around 800 informal settlements often built around farther parts of the larger cities.In these remote，informal settlements，electricity as well as water isn't reliably available.Besides，many Chileans in informal settlements also board up their windows for privacy and security，limiting the amount of natural light.This means that even during the day，informal homes can be difficult places to meet，work or study.</p><p>Glogau's design aims to use Chile's abundance in two natural resources&mdash;seawater and light&mdash;to create the skylight that can help solve the problem.</p><p>During the day，the skylight is powered by a small solar panel，with the center part of the skylight also functioning to desalinate(淡化) seawater via the evaporation and condensing(蒸发和冷凝) process.Water can then be tapped from the skylight to be used for consumption.</p><p>However，during the night，when light is in even more demand，the skylight can continue to function.The salt generated from the desalination process is stored within special tubes containing special metals.The salt reacts with these metals to create twelve &ldquo;salt batteries&rdquo; which can continue to power the skylight，thus providing lighting for living，work and study.</p><p>Currently，the skylight is being tested in informal settlements in Antofagasta，Chile.However，informal settlements aren't unique to Chile.According to the United Nations，around 1 billion people live in informal settlement conditions，with roughly 370 million in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia，238 million in sub-Saharan Africa and 227 million in Central and Southern Asia.Naturally，not all of these have access to seawater，but products such as the Solar Desalination Skylight can still point the way to providing necessities that can help improve living conditions and opportunities，at an affordable cost.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-04-08T10:02:41","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。生活在世界各地非正式定居点的人们常常为了获得清洁的水和电而铤而走险。如今，一种新发明的天窗只需要海水和阳光就可以安全地提供这两种生活必需品。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"851400766911419415","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3985068,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-06-08T17:28:23","uploadBatch":"1680919361061","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"mistakesQuestionId":null,"ordered":9,"question":{"answer":"B","answerExplanation":"<p>细节理解题。根据第三段中的&ldquo;Before

robots appear to engage with people and display human-like emotions，people may think of them as capable of &ldquo;thinking&rdquo;，or acting on their own beliefs and desires rather than their programs，according to the research published by the American Psychological Association.</p><p>&ldquo;The relationship between human-like shape，human-like behavior and the tendency to attribute(把&hellip;&hellip;归因于) independent thought and intentional behavior to robots is yet to be understood，&rdquo; said study author Agnieszka Wykowska，PhD，a principal investigator at the Italian Institute of Technology.&ldquo;As artificial intelligence increasingly becomes a part of our lives，it is important to understand how interacting with a robot that displays human-like behaviors might cause higher likelihood of attribution of intentional agency to the robot.&rdquo;</p><p>Across three experiments involving 119 participants，researchers examined how individuals would see a human-like robot，the iCub，after socializing with it and watching videos together.Before and after interacting with the robot，participants completed a questionnaire that showed them pictures of the robot in different situations and asked them to choose whether the robot's motivation in each situation was mechanical or intentional.</p><p>The researchers found that participants who watched videos with the human-like robot were more likely to rate the robot's actions as intentional，rather than programmed，while those who only interacted with the machine-like robot were not.This shows that mere exposure to a human-like robot is not enough to make people believe it is capable of thoughts and emotions.It is human-like behavior that might be crucial for being <u>deemed</u> as an intentional agent.</p><p>According to Wykowska，these findings show that people might be more likely to believe artificial intelligence is capable of independent thought when it creates the impression that it can behave just like humans.&ldquo;This could inform the design of social robots of the future，&rdquo; she

Ambiguous things like &ldquo;I want to find love&rdquo; or &ldquo;I want to get a promotion&rdquo; are unrealistic goals as they are determined by external forces that are out of our control.You cannot achieve what you can't control.Only work towards achieving what you are capable of.For instance，since we have no say as to who gets a promotion at work，this desire of being promoted can be broken down into achievable goals of increasing productivity and being more assertive(自信果敢的)．</p><p>&bull;<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><b><u>3</u></b><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p><p>Just because we have set a goal that we need to achieve this coming year does not mean we should start it on the first day of the first month of the year.Starting anything is not easy，and it requires mental and physical preparation. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>4</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>. That can lead to easy failure or giving up.</p><p><b>&bull;</b><b>Track</b><b> </b><b>your</b><b> </b><b>progress</b></p><p>Maybe there are some ways to know you are on course to achieve your goals. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>5</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>. One can only be certain they are making headway on their resolutions if they have a way of determining their progress.To know we are headed towards the goal，we need to know how far we have come and how much further we have to go.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-04-08T10:02:41","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了如何通过精心设计的行动计划实现新年目标。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"851400766911419417","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"Have a game plan","optionB":"Start when you are ready","optionC":"Here are some easy steps to turn the written hopes into fruition","optionD":"The best is to establish a method that quantifies your improvement","optionE":"We have all made New Year's resolutions that have not worked in the past","optionF":"Avoid writing down things you desire but are not 100 percent in your control","optionG":"To say you will start on January 1st is to start too early and without preparedness","options":[{"option":"A","optionContent":"Have a game plan","questionId":"851400766911419417"},{"option":"B","optionContent":"Start when you are ready","questionId":"851400766911419417"},{"option":"C","optionContent":"Here are some easy steps to turn the written hopes into fruition","questionId":"851400766911419417"},{"option":"D","optionContent":"The best is to establish a method that quantifies your improvement","questionId":"851400766911419417"},{"option":"E","optionContent":"We have all made New Year's resolutions that have not worked in the past","questionId":"851400766911419417"},{"option":"F","optionContent":"Avoid writing down things you desire but are not 100 percent in your control","questionId":"851400766911419417"},{"option":"G","optionContent":"To say you will start on January 1st is to start too early and without preparedness","questionId":"851400766911419417"}],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3985070,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"4","typeDetailName":"七选五","typeId":"59","typeName":"七选五","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-06-08T17:28:23","uploadBatch":"1680919361061","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null}],"title":""}],"templateId":"227191","templateName":"智能题卡22"},"msg":null}
