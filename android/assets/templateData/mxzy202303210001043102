recent times，with the advent of electric cars，the idea to fuel them with solar energy also gained momentum.Electric cars&mdash;even though they run on electricity and don&rsquo;t use fossil fuels&mdash;are still NOT GREEN！People suffer from the misconception that not using fossil fuel means &ldquo;green&rdquo; which is kind of absurd，considering the electricity we use is generated by burning the very same fuels!</p><p>However，what if your car had solar panels that could charge it？Now that would indeed be a green machine！Basically，as much as we would like to incorporate this energy source into our car，the efficiency of the currently used solar panels is subject to the fulfillment of different criteria.</p><p>Firstly，solar panels occupy a large amount of area.An average car has an area of 10－25 sq.ft.on the roof，which can generate between 50－150 W under ideal conditions.This is hardly enough power to illuminate a light bulb！Also，moderate sunny temperature needs to be ideal，as extremely high temperatures can reduce the efficiency of the solar panels.Cars must work in all weather conditions，so if a solar panel limits the car&rsquo;s functionality，it becomes practically useless.More importantly，the cost of the panels and development required to power the electronics using the sun&rsquo;s energy outweighs the benefits that solar panels provide.</p><p>Most cars today that have solar roofs，use the solar energy to power only a few basic functions of the car.While there is still time before we will be able to drive cars fully powered by solar energy，there are some alternatives，such as solar power stations，which are being designed to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels for electricity.</p><p>Solar-powered vehicles are surely the future，but not the near future.As the cost of solar panels continues to fall and their efficiency increases，things will begin to look much &ldquo;brighter&rdquo; for this alternative and sustainable
