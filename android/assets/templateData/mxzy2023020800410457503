I was a child，I dreamed of becoming many things.Sometimes，I wished I was an astronaut going up into space，finding new planets and jumping around in a cool space suit.Other times，I imagined being a cowboy in the Wild West，wearing stylish cowboy boots.On other occasions，I pretended to be a famous footballer，using my skills to score lots of goals for my team.</p><p>Looking back，I realize that imagination is a wonderful thing.I was able to create entire environments and <u>scenarios</u> in my head，using nothing more than my brain，and to adapt things in my everyday surroundings to fit the specific story of the day.Growing up with siblings(兄弟姐妹) also helped，as it meant that even bigger stories could be created，if we combined our ideas and put our thoughts into action.It also allowed for more varieties in the stories，as sometimes I could be the hero while on other occasions，I would be the bad guy.</p><p>One of my all-time favourite memories as a kid was playing in my back garden.I played the role of <i>Indiana</i> <i>Jones</i>，which cleaned up at the cinema at that time，with my younger sister as my assistant and my brother as a bad person.We used everything in our garden，from the path to the fence，as part of the storyline to create obstacles that needed to be overcome，and we would keep the story going for hours!</p><p>My personal favourite game was Indiana Jones and the Stolen Easter Eggs，where my brother hid small chocolate eggs around the garden and my sister and I had to find them by answering questions or solving a puzzle.It was difficult，but eventually we found all the eggs and shared them together.</p><p>Since then，I have seen many great things and met many amazing people.The elements of fun and varieties of my creative imaginations are what I try to bring into every part of my positive life.So I enjoy sharing with and hearing about other people&rsquo;s stories，too.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:47:09","decipherment":"本文是一篇夹叙夹议文。想象力是人类创新的源泉，是创造的动力，会影响一个人的人生态度。&ldquo;我&rdquo;的童年就是一段充满想象力的美好岁月，&ldquo;我&rdquo;现在的积极人生态度得益于此。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"832884881271821622","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3711756,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-02-27T09:46:13.995","uploadBatch":"1676533629871","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":28,"question":{"answer":"C","answerExplanation":"<p>细节理解题。根据文章第一段第二句&ldquo;These

you want to convince the boss you deserve a pay rise or promotion，the solution could be simple&mdash;eat the same food as they do.Psychologists have discovered managers are much more likely to instantly trust us if we choose the same dishes as them.</p><p>During experiments，discussions over wages and work conditions were much more successful if both sides chose to snack on the same treats.And shoppers were much more likely to buy a product advertised on TV by someone eating a similar food to them at the time.</p><p>The reason is thought to be so-called similarity attraction theory&mdash;where people tend to like others who have similar tastes or habits to themselves.But this is believed to be one of the first studies highlighting the role of food in this relationship.Researchers at Chicago University in the US conducted a series of experiments to examine food&rsquo;s role in earning trust.</p><p>In a test，participants were told to watch TV&mdash;where someone pretending to be a member of the public praised a certain product.The volunteers were given Kit Kat bars to nibble(咬)，while the TV people ate either a Kit Kat or grapes as they talked.</p><p>The results showed viewers were much more likely to express an interest in buying the product if the TV showed the other person eating a Kit Kat too.</p><p>The researchers added，&ldquo;Although similarity in food consumption is not a sign of whether two people will get along，we find consumers treat this as such.They feel more trusting of those who consume as they do.It means people can immediately begin to feel friendship and develop a bond，leading to smoother transactions(交易) from the start.&rdquo;</p><p>Harley Street psychologist Dr Lucy Atcheson said it was already known that wearing similar clothes could instantly create trust.But this was the first report that food had the same effect.She said，&ldquo;This is really interesting.It makes sense as people feel they have common ground and can trust the other person.That means negotiations are more likely to be successful.&rdquo;</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:47:09","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文，主要介绍了&ldquo;相似吸引理论&rdquo;，这种理论告诉我们人们倾向于喜欢和他们有相似口味和习惯的人。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"832884881271821624","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3711758,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-02-27T09:46:13.995","uploadBatch":"1676533629871","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":36,"question":{"answer":"G","answerExplanation":"<p>根据上文&ldquo;这些技能有助于调节你周围的环境&rdquo;和下文&ldquo;换句话说，你可以学习一些技巧来帮助管理负面的情绪&rdquo;可知，该空提出另外一类技能，G选项&ldquo;但帮助调节你内心的技能也同样重要&rdquo;切题，选项中的&ldquo;skills&rdquo;对应上下文中的&ldquo;skills&rdquo;，选项中的&ldquo;regulate&rdquo;对应上文中的&ldquo;regulate&rdquo;，故选G。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:47:09","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"832884881364096314","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"Guide
