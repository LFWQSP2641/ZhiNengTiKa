fight against the ballooning waistlines among people，several U．S.cities have instituted taxes on drinks with added sugar aiming to reduce consumption，but new research suggests these policies currently have one fundamental <u>flaw</u>.</p><p>The study found sugary drinks only reduce purchasing if price tags at stores mention consumers are paying that tax when they buy the drink.</p><p>The research included a field study at two convenience stores in San Francisco，which currently has a tax on sugary drinks of 1 cent per ounce.Researchers varied the price tags placed on the sugary drinks over the eight-week study：one tag that simply said the price for the 12-ounce drink($1.52) and one that had the price and the message &ldquo;Includes SF Sugary Drink Tax&rdquo;．All non-sugary drinks，which weren't subject to the tax，simply had the price of the drink($1.40)．</p><p>The researchers compared sales of the drinks during the study period to the two weeks before the study began when the sugary drink tax was in effect but there were no price tags on any drinks.Results showed sales of sugary drinks weren't lower during the two weeks，compared to sales before the tax，indicating the tax itself didn't reduce purchases of sugary drinks.</p><p>The researchers then looked at the effects of the two different price tags.Results showed the share of sugary drinks purchased when the tags simply showed the price wasn't significantly different from that of the two-week period before the study，but did decline slightly when the tags mentioned the price included the added tax.</p><p>In a separate online study，the researchers asked participants to estimate what the tax would be on a can of their favorite drink that cost $1.52.The average estimate was 40 cents&mdash;much higher than the 12 cents actually demanded in San Francisco.When told the tax was only 12 cents，they reported they'd still purchase the drink.</p><p>The findings suggest price tags should mention the tax but not the amount，for consumers tend to overestimate how much the tax is.&ldquo;If cities want these policies to be effective，they need to regulate how sugary drinks are labeled at stores and they currently don't do that，&rdquo; said Donnelly，lead author of the

<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>2</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> Flowers such as zinnia，calendula，and cosmos are some of the easiest.Good choices for vegetables are lettuce，kale，cabbage，and the ever-popular tomato.</p><p>To get started，you need a container and soil.The container should be between 5 to 10 centimeters deep.What's most important is that the container should have holes in the bottom so that some water can drain out(排出)．Garden soil，says Riech，will not work.It does not drain quickly enough in a container. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>3</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> Potting soil has additional material such as perlite，vermiculite，or sand to improve drainage.</p><p>Fill the containers with the potting soil and push it down.Then plant seeds.Cover the seed with the potting soil and press gently again.Place the containers in a pan which holds water that reaches halfway up the containers with the seeds.After a few hours，remove them from the water.</p><p>Most seeds do not need light to germinate(发芽)． <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>4</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p><p>Now for the exciting part&mdash;waiting to see little，green sprouts(芽)！Remove all but the strongest sprout from each container.Your goal now is to grow strong transplants that can survive a move to the outside garden.In four to six weeks，most transplants should be two to three times the height of their containers. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>5</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> Now they are ready to go into the garden!</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-04-08T10:02:20","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文，主要讲的是如何培育供移植的幼苗，然后往花园里移植。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"851400680823329809","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"First，what
