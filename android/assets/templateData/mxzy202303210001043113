had a few.But then again，too few to mention，&rdquo; Frank Sinatra chanted in his 1969 hit &ldquo;My Way&rdquo;．The song's idea is attractive：that anyone can just declare what's done is done and move on.Some take the declaration a step further and claim they have no regrets at all.Whether a boast or an actual attitude，&ldquo;no regrets&rdquo; suggests that life can and should be lived without looking through the rear-view mirror.</p><p>Easier said than done，though.In 2020，author Daniel H．Pink launched the World Regret Survey，the largest ever survey on the topic.With his research team，Pink asked more than 15,000 people in 105 countries，&ldquo;How often do you look back on your life and wish you had done things differently？&rdquo; 82% said regret is at least an occasional part of their life；roughly 21% said they feel regret &ldquo;all the time&rdquo;．Only 1% said they never feel regret.</p><p>If you are of the &ldquo;no regrets&rdquo; type，you might think that all this regret is a recipe for unhappiness.But that isn't the case.True，being overwhelmed by regret is indeed bad for you.But going to the other extreme may be even worse.To rid yourself of regrets doesn't free you from shame or sorrow；it leads you to make the same mistakes again and again.To truly get over our guilt requires that we put regret in its proper place.</p><p>As uncomfortable as it is，regret is an amazing cognitive(认知) achievement.If today your relationship with your partner has soured，your regret might mentally take you back to last year.You would remember your being mean and sensitive，and then imagine yourself showing more patience，being kind instead of hurtful at key moments.Then you would fast-forward to today and see how your relationship could be progressing instead of <u>languishing</u>.</p><p>But regret doesn't have to be left unmanaged.The trick is to acknowledge it and use it for learning and improvement.You can be honest with yourself about what went wrong and use that knowledge to enjoy better relationships in the future.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-04-08T10:01:38","decipherment":"这是一篇说明文。世界上不同的人对于&ldquo;后悔&rdquo;有不同的态度，而作者认为适当的后悔才能帮助我们不断进步。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"851400504738059082","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3984922,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-06-08T17:22:04","uploadBatch":"1680919298549","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"mistakesQuestionId":null,"ordered":13,"question":{"answer":"A","answerExplanation":"<p>前文提到有些朋友会伴你一生，结合下文陈述维持长期友谊的好处以及如何保持长期友谊可知，A项&ldquo;终生友谊是大多数人所渴望的&rdquo;符合文意。故选A项。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-04-08T10:01:38","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"851400504771613520","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"Lifelong
