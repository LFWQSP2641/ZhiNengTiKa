Colwell is a mixed-media artist in Redmond，Washington.In grade school，a teacher told her that she had no artistic talent and Lynn believed her.However，in 2015 when she retired，she hoped to have a new interest and began to take a year-long online painting class.</p><p>&ldquo;It blew me away，&rdquo; she says.She started painting striking portraits of women&rsquo;s faces，combined with short messages of hope almost every day.In five years，she&rsquo;s completed about 1,000 paintings.</p><p>Lynn gives her paintings away.She started with friends，but that only went so far.Then she read about a movement called Art Abandonment，which encourages artists to leave their art in public places for anyone to pick up.That gave her the idea of putting her work into the hands of strangers through Facebook.</p><p>Nearly every day，Lynn posts a painting on her Facebook page.The first person who responds saying they&rsquo;re interested in it has 24 hours to make a donation of $ 25 or more to their favorite nonprofit or an individual in need.Then the painting is theirs.Lynn doesn&rsquo;t ask for proof.She trusts that the people who want her paintings share her ideas.</p><p>Five years later，she&rsquo;s still amazed at the results.Her paintings have raised more than $ 57,000 for nonprofit organizations such as animal rescue centers，homeless shelters as well as for people who have lost their jobs.Sometimes Lynn hears that a painting helped someone at the moment who needed it most.&ldquo;That gives me chills，&rdquo; she says.</p><p>To be a part of Lynn Colwell&rsquo;s art-for-a-cause effort，send her a friend request at <i>facebook</i>.<i>com</i>/<i>lynncol</i><i>w</i><i>ell</i>.Then keep an eye out for a painting that speaks to you.Lynn personally approves each request，so she asks for your patience.Also，she spends most of her time in her art studio&mdash;there&rsquo;s painting to be done.&ldquo;I wake up every day and can&rsquo;t wait to get started，&rdquo;

Not likely.That&rsquo;s because when it comes to getting from point A to point B as fast as possible，human drivers put their own goals first.Individual ants have to be more cooperative in order to

tales perform many functions.They entertain，encourage imagination，and teach problem-solving skills.They can also provide moral lessons，highlighting the dangers of failing to follow the social rules that let human beings coexist in harmony.Such moral lessons may not mean much to a robot，but a team of researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology(GIT) believes it has found a way to turn the instructive fable(寓言) into a moral lesson that artificial intelligence(AI) can take to its cold，mechanical heart.</p><p>This，the researchers hope，will help prevent the intelligent robots from harming or even killing humanity，which is predicted and feared by some of the biggest names in technology，including Stephen Hawking，Elon Musk and Bill Gates.</p><p>Mark Riedl，an associate professor of interactive computing at Georgia Tech，believes that the collected stories of different cultures not only teach children how to behave well but also teach robots how to get rid of violent or dangerous behavior and help them make choices that won&rsquo;t harm humans and still achieve the intended purpose.</p><p>The system is called &ldquo;Quixote&rdquo;．The experiment involves going to a chemist to buy some medicine for a human who needs it as soon as possible.The robot has three choices.It can wait in line; it can communicate with the chemist politely and buy the medicine; it can steal the medicine.Without any further instructions，the robot will come to the conclusion that the most efficient means of getting the medicine is to steal it.Quixote offers a reward signal for waiting in line and politely buying the medicine and a punishment signal for taking it without permission.In this way，it learns the &ldquo;moral&rdquo; way to behave in that situation.</p><p>Quixote would work best on a robot that has a very limited function.It&rsquo;s a baby step in the direction of teaching more moral lessons into robots.We believe that AI has to be trained to adopt the values of a particular society，and in doing so，it will strive to avoid unacceptable behavior.Giving robots the ability to read and understand our stories may be the most efficient means.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:45:29","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章主要讲了研究人员已经找到了一种方法，把具有教育意义的寓言变成机器人能够理解的道德准则，让机器人也拥有特定的社会价值观。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"832884458708276463","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3711351,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-02-27T09:45:51.516","uploadBatch":"1676533529124","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":36,"question":{"answer":"A","answerExplanation":"<p>根据下文各段的段首句以及空格后句可知，此处是该段的主旨句，讲述的是给予的好处且强调给予别人的行为会影响给予者的情绪。所以A项(给予让你更快乐)能够概括段落主旨，故选A。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:45:29","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"832884458796356856","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"Giving
