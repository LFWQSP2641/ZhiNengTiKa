consumption habits are doing more harm to the planet than women&rsquo;s，according to a new study from Sweden.</p><p>For the study，consumption-based greenhouse gas(GHG) emissions were measured for the average individual，the average single man，and the average single woman.These were estimated to be 6.9,10，and 8.5 tons per capita per year respectively，and more than half of those amounts were due to food，holidays，and furnishings.</p><p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that single men and women spend similar amounts of money on consumer goods，but men&rsquo;s choices lead to 16% more GHG emissions than women&rsquo;s.That is because they choose to spend money on things like cars and driving，rather than taking public transportation or trains，as women are more willing to do.More of men&rsquo;s money goes toward alcohol，tobacco，and eating out，while women are used to spending on clothes，home furnishings，and health-based purchases.</p><p>Curiously，there were no major differences in the carbon

   When I was loading up my backpack，Mrs Sather asked me to go to her.Mrs Sather stared into my eyes as if seeing my inner self locked away inside.&ldquo;I would love you to give this a try for me.But if you really don&rsquo;t want to，I won&rsquo;t make you.It is your choice.&rdquo; Mrs Sather wanted me in this role.She shocked me，for I was always a shy person，and didn&rsquo;t even dare to speak loud in public.</p><p>Hearing Mrs Sather&rsquo;s words，I realized it was time to make a change.I decided to throw off my shy cloak.I wanted to prove that I also could do something good in public.After seconds of hesitation，I nodded my head，confidently saying，&ldquo;Mrs Sather，I want to，no，I am determined to play the role.And I will try my best to perform it well.&rdquo;Looking at me with a big smile on her face，Mrs Sather said，&ldquo;I believe in you.If you meet any problem，you can turn to me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Thank you！&rdquo; I left her office happily.</p>","answerExplanation":"","cityId":null,"content":"<p>阅读下面材料，根据其内容和所给段落开头语续写两段，使之构成一篇完整的短文。</p><p>I looked out at the smiling faces packed into the school hall.Flashes from cameras lit up in all directions.The applause filled my ears.I had done it.I had really done it.</p><p>Just a few months earlier，I would never have pictured myself acting in a play in front of two hundred people.&ldquo;Not for a million dollars，&rdquo; I would have said.But when the time came，I got up on stage and faced one of my greatest fears&mdash;and discovered I could do more than I ever gave myself credit for.I found a new person inside me，a much more daring，outgoing person who had been hidden all along，just waiting for the opportunity to appear.</p><p>If not for my teacher，Mrs Sather，I might never have found that opportunity.</p><p>In the first and second grade，I was extremely shy.I had friends，but it just wasn&rsquo;t in my personality to be very outgoing，even when I knew someone well.I was afraid I would do or say something wrong，so usually I just smiled and listened to other people&rsquo;s conversations.I did well in school and I loved to write.However，I would escape into my writing，where I could be myself and never had to worry about what other people thought of me.In my stories，I was never shy.</p><p>My teacher，Mrs Sather，always encouraged me to write more.She told our class to go after our dreams and dig in with both hands.I think she was one of the first people to see my inner strength.One day，she announced that our class was going to perform a play she had written.&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin to cast everyone tomorrow，&rdquo;she said.&ldquo;I need someone who is not afraid to be on stage in front of a lot of people to play the lead part of Dorothy.Anybody want to try？&rdquo;A few excited hands shot up&mdash;mine，of course，was not one of them&mdash;and Mrs Sather smiled.&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk more about it tomorrow，&rdquo;she said.Then the bell rang and my classmates slowly left the classroom.</p><p>注意：续写词数应为150左右。</p><p>When I was loading up my backpack，Mrs Sather asked me to go to
