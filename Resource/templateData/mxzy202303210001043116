in Singapore last November，Hong Kong-based company Omnifoods has introduced a range of six plant-based sea foods to stand in for tuna，crab and whitefish.Similar to their pork substitutes，the new products are said to offer a safe and alternative source of protein while tackling environmental concerns like overfishing and worsening of the seas.</p><p>Omnifoods' expansion comes at a time when the market for plant-based products is growing.According to <i>Enterprise</i> <i>Singapore</i>，local interest in sensible consumption doubled in 2021，and flexitarians&mdash;people who primarily eat a plant-based diet but occasionally consume meat or seafood&mdash;represent the fastest growth.The ocean is another reason cited as the need for plant-based seafood.The average person here consumed 22kg of seafood last year，surpassing the global average of 20kg.The World Wide Fund for Nature(WWF) also observed that three quarters of the seafood served in Singapore is unsustainable.Besides，fish farming involves the use of chemicals to prevent disease and parasites and these chemicals then accumulate in fish tissues，which becomes a serious threat to people's health.</p><p>Omnifoods says their products address all these concerns.Made primarily from non-genetically modified soybeans，the plant-based alternatives are free of harmful substances，absolutely safe.The company pointed out that the products share a similar look，feel and taste of the real thing.&ldquo;We've done pilot taste tests with friends，family，and one sushi restaurant.Many admire the appearance and mouthfeel that our tuna product has as well as its nutritional benefits.Now we are struggling to improve our product until it's an exact match or tastes better than animal-based tuna，&rdquo; added David Yeung.</p><p>Besides Omnifoods，Singapore companies are also exploring the alternative seafood market.Growthwell Group recently raised US $22 million to fund its attempt into shrimp，squid and crab made using chickpea protein.&ldquo;Global demand for plant-based meats is also shooting up，with the value set to reach US $ 23.2 billion by 2024，&rdquo; said market research company
