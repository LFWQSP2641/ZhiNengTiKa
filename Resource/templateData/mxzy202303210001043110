the spring of 2013，my wife and I opened Literati Bookstore in Ann Arbor，Michigan.Opening a community-minded independent bookstore was a dream we&rsquo;d shared.We were in our late twenties，pursuing a dream.</p><p>When opening day arrived，we unlocked the door and held our breath.One by one，people walked inside，paged through new books，and discussed favourite authors.The bookstore came alive.</p><p>That morning，I had set out a typewriter on our lower level for anyone to use.It was a community-building experiment：What if people could walk into a bookstore and type anything they wanted?</p><p>The first typewriter I ever fell in love with was my grandfather&rsquo;s&mdash;a 1930s Smith Corona.My memory of him is limited to impressions：visits to his Florida apartment，beach picnics，and a fascinating black typewriter on his writing desk.One year，long after he passed，Grandma gave me his Smith Corona for Christmas.At the time，I was a struggling writer.Seeing his old typewriter again stirred something in me.His typewriter made writing fun again.And for the first time since his death，I felt connected to him，to a past I never really knew.</p><p>The typewriter I set out on the opening day was a light blue Olivetti Lettera 32.I inserted a clean piece of paper and let it be：the world&rsquo;s smallest publishing house，waiting for an author.One of the notes I found that first day was：Thank you for being here.I didn&rsquo;t see the typer&rsquo;s identity，so it appeared as though the typewriter itself was thanking me.Soon，more notes accumulated.Typewriting had become part of our bookstore&rsquo;s identity.</p><p>Customers and friends began encouraging me to turn these notes into a book.At first，I was hesitant.But then I read through the piles of

bio-plastics are being made in laboratories from straw，wood chips and food waste，with researchers aiming to replace oil as the source of the world&rsquo;s plastic.</p><p>The new approaches include genetically modifying bacteria to eat wood and produce useful chemicals.But the bio-plastics are currently significantly more expensive to make than fossil fuel-based plastics.</p><p>Land and seas around the world，from high mountains to deep oceans，have become polluted with plastic，prompting major public concern.The world has produced 8bn tons of plastic since the 1950s and demand is still rising.</p><p>While some waste plastic is recycled，much of it is burnt to produce electricity，resulting in carbon emissions that drive climate change.In contrast to plastic made from oil，plastics made from plant-based materials only release the carbon the plants absorbed from the air as they grew.Bio-plastics will also give more options for products that biodegrade(生物降解) in the environment，although they can be made very long-lasting if required.</p><p>&ldquo;Plastics are an incredible enhancement to our daily lives，&rdquo; said Paul Mines，CEO of Biome Technologies in the UK，which has spent ￡5m in the last five years on bio-plastics research.&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t go on using fossil fuel-based materials.About 6－7% of every barrel(桶) of oil is used to make plastics.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Using plant materials is <u>feasible</u>，&rdquo; said professor Simon，at the University of York.&ldquo;Replacing half of the nation&rsquo;s plastic bottles could be done

of tons of conventional plastic.Mines said this could rise to about 20,000 tons in the next five
