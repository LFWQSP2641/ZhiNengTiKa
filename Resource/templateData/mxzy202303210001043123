days of staring at the computer screen pretending to be interested in an assignment even though you are bored out of your mind may soon be coming to an end.That's because if Dr Harry Witchel，Discipline Leader in Physiology at England's Brighton and Sussex Medical School，has his way，computers of the future will be able to detect boredom and even react to it real-time.</p><p>But before you get concerned，the machine is not reading your mind.It is just keeping track of the constant involuntary(无意识的)movements that people exhibit when in front of a computer or even a television.These are not the bigger instrumental actions like moving a mouse or using the remote，but barely noticeable movements like scratching，fidgeting，or stretching.Witchel says the level of movement is directly linked to how absorbed the person is in what he or she is reading or watching.The higher the interest level，the less the movement!</p><p>To test the theory，Witchel and his team invited 27 people and exposed them to a variety of digital contents for three minutes at a time.The activities ranged from playing online games to reading documents like the banking regulations that most people would find boring.</p><p>A video motion tracker monitored their movements as they powered through each assignment.Just as the researchers had expected，the involuntary actions decreased dramatically，by as much as 42%，when the participants were totally absorbed in what they were reading or seeing.</p><p>Fortunately，the scientists are not planning to use the findings to create machines that report students who are not focusing at school.Instead，they believe that combining the motion-detecting technology with future computers will help enhance the digital learning experience.</p><p>The scientists say that being able to measure the students' interest level will enable educators to adjust the materials real-time and re-engage the students.Witchel also believes that the technology can provide filmmakers with honest audience
