a year to maintain their certified status.&rdquo;</p><p>The volunteer work of Master Gardeners helps local Extension offices reach a broader audience than is possible through just the efforts of Extension agents.Volunteers take on a variety of community beautification projects and extend the educational arm of the university to the public by providing horticultural information based on university research and recommendations.</p><p>&ldquo;Master Gardener volunteers experience the personal satisfaction of serving their community，gaining horticultural expertise and connecting with
