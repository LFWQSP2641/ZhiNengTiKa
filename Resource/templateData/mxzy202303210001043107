has been gaining popularity recently as a skill that some blind people use to precisely map the surroundings.They can detect trees，buildings or doorways by making a clicking sound with their mouths and listening for the echo.</p><p>However，research has shown <u>this</u> can be learned by anyone，blind or sighted.A growing body of research encourages us to awake senses that have been neglected.Just by using mouth clicks，echo experts can tell whether an object 2m away is a car or tree.</p><p>This does not mean echolocation provides people with the same accuracy as vision.Human echolocators struggle to track tiny targets.And it only works for three-dimensional objects.However，Lore Thaler，one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts on human echolocation，says it is still a very powerful technique.</p><p>Thaler and her colleagues are currently studying brain scans of sighted and blind people who are learning to echolocate.So far，results have shown something rather surprising：When sighted people learn to navigate by sound，they engage the part of their brain that usually deals with vision.</p><p>&ldquo;We like to think of vision as a sense that&rsquo;s by itself，and there are certain resources dedicated to it，such as the eyes and specific parts of the brain.But instead，our brain may be able to process sensory information somewhat more flexibly&mdash;&lsquo;seeing&rsquo; with our ears，if you like.It&rsquo;s just that usually，for sighted people，there is no reason to do so，&rdquo; says Thaler.</p><p>In everyday life，our real sensory superpower lies not in any individual skill，but in their combination.This is because each sense is limited on its own.Our peripheral vision(外围视觉)，for example，is rather poor.But we can combine it with another sense，like hearing，to make out where something is，say，an approaching car.This is known as the &ldquo;bimodal precision advantage(双峰精度优势)&rdquo;．</p><p>It&rsquo;s strange to think that echolocation has been inside us，unused and unnoticed.Who knows what other hidden senses are waiting to be
