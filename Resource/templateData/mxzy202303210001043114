this month，Tate Britain will host its first Van Gogh exhibition since 1947.Here we've rounded up 4 of his best paintings before the show.</p><p><b><i>Potato</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Eaters</i></b></p><p><i>Potato</i> <i>Eaters</i> was Van Gogh's first major work and，despite a distinct lack of colour，it was one that he was most proud of.His aim was to represent the difficulties of country life，so the farmers were painted in earthy tones with rough faces and bony hands.He was more concerned with conveying his message than achieving technical perfection in this painting.</p><p><b><i>Irises</i></b></p><p>Van Gogh finished almost 142 pieces during his stay in the Saint Remy de Provence Asylum(精神病院)where he was a voluntary patient from 1889 to 1890.This piece was started shortly after he arrived there.The hospital garden provided much inspiration for the artist during his stay there.Originally，the flowers in this work were painted purple but the red pigment(色素) faded over time and has now turned blue.</p><p><b><i>Cafe</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Terrace</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>at</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Night</i></b></p><p>Despite being painted more than 130 years ago，this cafe still exists in France and has since been renamed the Cafe Van Gogh.This artwork marks the first time Van Gogh's famous post-impressionistic star-filled sky was seen in a piece，and it was painted on the ground，in person，rather than from memory.While the artwork doesn't bear his signature，it's widely known to be Van Gogh's，as he mentioned <i>Cafe</i> <i>Terrace</i> <i>at</i> <i>Night</i> in a number of his letters.</p><p><b><i>Wheat</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Field</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>w</i></b><b><i>ith</i></b><b><i> </i></b><b><i>Cypresses</i></b></p><p>This piece was inspired by the view from Van Gogh's asylum window and was finished on the spot.The work was the title of three paintings that offer an insight into his stay at the hospital.Van Gogh was so pleased with the summer landscape that he made three copies there，one of the same size&mdash;which hangs in the National Gallery and two smaller copies which he planned to gift to his mother and sister.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-04-08T10:01:45","decipherment":"本文是一篇应用文，主要介绍了梵高的四幅代表作。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"851400532672123724","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":4,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3984941,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-06-08T17:22:04","uploadBatch":"1680919305198","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"mistakesQuestionId":null,"ordered":4,"question":{"answer":"A","answerExplanation":"<p>细节理解题。根据第二段内容可知，这篇文章关注的痴呆的风险因素是睡眠不足。故选A。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"<p>What

who regularly sleep for six hours or less each night in middle age are more likely to develop dementia(痴呆) than those who routinely manage seven hours，according to a major study into the disease.</p><p>Researchers found a 30% greater risk of dementia in those who during their 50s，60s and 70s consistently had a short night's sleep，regardless of other risk factors such as heart condition and poor mental health.</p><p>Sabia，an author of the study at the university of Paris，and her colleagues analyzed survey data from University College London's Whitehall study，which launched in 1985 and followed the health and lifestyles of more than 10,000 British volunteers.The French team focused on nearly 8,000 participants who self-reported their sleep patterns.</p><p>During 25 years of follow-up，521 participants developed dementia，with most diagnosed in their late 70s.Writing in <i>Nature</i> <i>Communications</i>，the scientists described how those who routinely got six hours of sleep or less each night in their 50s and 60s were 30% more likely to develop dementia than those who typically managed seven hours.</p><p>The study does not prove that sleeping too little causes dementia，since sleep loss itself may be one of the earliest symptoms of the disease.But some scientists believe the results strengthen evidence that continuous poor sleep may at least contribute to the disease.</p><p>The first pathological changes that lead to dementia occur one to two decades before the disease becomes obvious，as sticky proteins called amyloid build up in the brain.When the 1985 Whitehall study first assessed the sleep of volunteers who later developed dementia，this process had probably not started.This meant that if they were sleeping too little，it was unlikely to have been caused by dementia-related brain changes.</p><p>&ldquo;It strengthens the evidence that poor sleep in middle age could cause or worsen dementia in later life，&rdquo; said Dr Liz Coulthard，a consultant senior lecturer in dementia neurology(神经病学)．&ldquo;It makes sense to take measures to improve sleep such as going outside during daylight hours to help maintain the natural rhythms that
